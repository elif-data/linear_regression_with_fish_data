# linear_regression_with_fish_data


This project's aim was predicting the mass of the fish via fitting a linear model to two different datasets. 
For bream dataset the relationship between the explanatory variable and the response variable was already a straight line
but for perch dataset I had to transform the explanatory variable by raising it to the power of 3 so that the data points fit the trend line much better.
